- GET /api/patch-notes                           -> fetch public patch history list
- GET /api/patch-notes/{version}/changes         -> fetch change details for a specific version

- POST   /api/admin/patch-notes                  -> create patch note
- PATCH  /api/admin/patch-notes/{patchNoteId}    -> update patch note

- POST   /api/admin/patch-note-changes           -> create patch change

<business-rules>
- Latest/current patch note is shown by default on page load.
- Patch history list lets users navigate to previous patches.
- Patch note list response uses ApiResponse&lt;List&lt;PatchNoteResponse&gt;&gt; and does not include full changes.
- Patch change response uses ApiResponse&lt;PatchChangePageResponse&gt; and includes items, page, pageSize, totalItems, totalPages, stats.
- PatchChangePageResponse.stats is nested under the response payload. Frontend normalization must prefer payload.stats before falling back to legacy top-level stats.
- stats are calculated from the selected patch version as a whole, not from the currently filtered page.
- Changes are categorized by backend enum values: CHAMPION, TRAIT, ITEM, AUGMENT, SYSTEM.
- Change type enum values are BUFF, NERF, ADJUST, NEW.
- Impact enum values are HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
- version param format matches backend storage key, for example "17.3".
- Local DB smoke data lives in patch_notes and patch_changes. patch_notes.version identifies one patch note.
- Admin endpoints are protected by X-Admin-Token through /api/admin/**.
- Admin writes use /api/admin/patch-notes and /api/admin/patch-note-changes.
- Admin delete uses soft delete through active/deletedAt. Do not hard delete patch note or patch change rows.
- highlightsJson and tagsJson must validate as JSON string arrays.
- isCurrent must stay unique among active, non-deleted patch notes.
- When a patch note is created or updated with current=true, existing active current patch notes must be unset.
- DB-level protection should also enforce a single active current patch note. If schema management is manual, apply the matching SQL migration/index before production-like testing.

<validation>
- Public service tests should cover list response, version not found, filtered change query, stats separation, page slicing, invalid pagination, empty filters, enum parsing, and LIKE escaping.
- Admin service tests should cover patch note CRUD, patch change CRUD, JSON array validation, duplicate/current behavior, not found errors, and soft delete.
- Swagger smoke testing should verify public APIs without admin token and admin APIs with X-Admin-Token.
</validation>

<data-ingestion>
- Current stage: curated DB/admin data first, then server smoke testing.
- Next stage: patch-note crawling/import after admin CRUD, current-patch uniqueness, and public stats contracts are stable.
- External crawling/import must write into the same patch_notes and patch_changes contract used by admin curation.
- AI server/FastAPI is not required for patch-note CRUD. Add it only when AI summarization/search/RAG behavior needs patch-note data.
